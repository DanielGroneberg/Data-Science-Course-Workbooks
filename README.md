# Data-Science-Course-Workbooks
This repository is intended to doccument my progress through the 2022 Python for Machine Learning & Data Science Masterclass by Pierian Data. Each file is named according to the subject of the course section. There are challenges throught the course, and I provide my answers as well as my notes while going over the solutions.

Before starting this course, I had some basic familiarity with Python, having used JuypterLab in Fluvial Geomorphology class in college to do calculations related to river discharge.
